FastAPI’s dependency injection system is one of its most powerful features. It allows you to manage shared resources, configuration, and services in a clean and maintainable way. In this blog, we’ll explore:

- What is Dependency Injection?
- How FastAPI implements dependency injection.
- Writing custom dependencies for database connections, authentication, and more.
- Using `Depends` effectively.

## Full Code Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends

app = FastAPI()

def common_dependency():
    return {"message": "Hello from a dependency!"}

@app.get("/")
def read_root(data: dict = Depends(common_dependency)):
    return data
```
